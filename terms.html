                <h3 class="other_h3">1. Our Mission.</h3>
                    <p class="other_p">Our mission is to create a world where you can access a wide variety of services such as cab
                        services, hitch-hiking services, short-term car rentals as well as tag-a-long experiences.

                <h3 class="other_h3">2. Searching and Booking of services on Sykel.</h3> 
                <h4>2.1 Searching.</h4>
                    <p class="other_p">You can search for Service Provider Services by using criteria like the type of
                        Service you want, type of vehicle you wish to rent (cars, motorbikes, bicycle, skateboard, etc.),
                        the kind of outing you wish to attend, the type of tag-a-long buddy you would like, places you
                        would like to meet your tag along buddies or go out to and the destination of your hitch-hike.
                        You can also use filters to refine your search results. Search results are based on their
                        relevance to your search and other criteria. Relevance considers factors like price, availability,
                        reviews, customer service and cancellation history, popularity, previous trips and saved listings,
                        service provider requirements, and more.
                    </p>
                <br>
                <h4>2.2 Booking.</h4>
                    <p class="other_p">When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your booking
                        including the cab fee, rental price, applicable fees like Sykel’s service fee, offline fees, taxes,
                        and any other items identified during checkout (collectively, <b>“Total Price”</b>). You are also
                        agreeing that Sykel via Sykel Payments may charge the Payment Method (as defined in the
                        Payment Terms) used to book the Listing in order to collect Damage Claim amounts. When you
                        receive the booking or reservation confirmation, a contract for Service Providers
                        (a<b> "Reservation"</b>) is formed directly between you and the Service Provider. In addition to these
                        Terms, you will be subject to, and responsible for complying with, all terms of the Reservation or
                        Booking, including without limitation, the cancellation policy and any other rules, standards,
                        policies, or requirements identified in the Listing or during checkout that apply to the
                        Reservation. It is your responsibility to read and understand these rules, standards, policies,
                        and requirements prior to booking a Listing. Be aware that some Service Providers work with a
                        co-Service Provider or as part of a team to provide their Service Provider Services.
                    </p>

                <h4>2.3 Tag-a-long experience and hitch-hiking..</h4>
                    <p class="other_p">This service enables a User to seek a tag-a-long
                        buddy going to the same destination from anywhere in their region. Users may agree on time,
                        date and meet-up point. This service extends to travelers seeking a ride to a destination as well
                        as Users looking for someone to tag-a-long to a local restaurant, activity, festival, place etc.

                <h4>2.4 Reservations for Experiences and Other Service Provider Services.</h4>
                    <p class="other_p">An Experience or other Service Provider Service Reservation entitles you to participate in, attend, or use that
                        Service Provider Service. You are responsible for confirming that you, and anyone you invite,
                        meet minimum age, proficiency, fitness, or other requirements. You are responsible for
                        informing the Service Provider of any medical or physical conditions, or other circumstances
                        that may impact your ability to participate, attend, or use the Service Provider Service. Except
                        where expressly authorized, you may not allow any person to join a Service Provider Service
                        unless they are included as an additional User during the booking process.
                    </p>

                <h4>2.5 Cab service.</h4>
                    <p class="other_p">Users may search for cab services available at the time of their request at
                        their convenience. Users may also book for cab services through Sykel.
                    </p>
                <br>
                <h4>2.6 Short-term car rentals.</h4>
                    <p class="other_p">Users may book or request short term car rentals listed in the app
                        at their convenience provided that they have a valid driver’s license. A valid driver’s license and
                        Identity Card (Omang) are a requirement for verification and safety purposes. Forging an
                        identity on this Platform is a crime punishable by law.

                <h3 class="other_h3">3. Cancellations, Travel Issues, Refunds and Booking Modifications.</h3>
                <h4>3.1 Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Refunds.</h4>
                    <p class="other_p">In general, if as a User you cancel a Reservation or booking, the amount refunded to you is determined by 
                        the cancellation policy that applies to that Reservation. But, in certain situations, other policies take precedence
                        and determine what amount is refunded to you. If something outside your control forces you to
                        cancel a Reservation or Booking, you may be eligible for a partial or full refund under
                        our Extenuating Circumstances Policy. If the Service Provider cancels, or you experience a
                        Travel Issue (as defined in our User Refund Policy), you may be eligible for rebooking
                        assistance or a partial or full refund under the User Refund Policy. Different policies apply to
                        certain categories of Listings; for example Experiences Reservations are governed by
                        the Experiences User Refund Policy. See each Additional Legal Term or Policy for details about
                        what is covered, and what refund applies in each situation.
                    </p>
                <br>
                <h4>3.2 Booking Modifications.</h4>
                    <p class="other_p">Users and Service Providers are responsible for any booking
                        modifications they agree to make via the Sykel Platform or direct Sykel APP customer service to
                        make on their behalf (<b>"Booking Modifications"</b>, and agree to pay any additional amounts,
                        fees, or taxes associated with any Booking Modification.
                    </p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="other_h3">4. Your Responsibilities and Assumption of Risk.</h3>
                <h4>4.1 Your Responsibilities.</h4>
                    <p class="other_p">You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and
                        are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or provide access to
                        any services provided in the Sykel APP, Experience or other Service Provider Service. For
                        example, this means: (i) you are responsible for leaving a rented vehicle (and related personal
                        property) in the condition it was in when you received it, (ii) you are responsible for paying all
                        reasonable Damage Claim amounts necessary to cover damage that you or your User(s) cause
                        to the rented property. and (iii) you must act with integrity, treat others with respect, and comply
                        with applicable laws at all times. If you are booking for an additional User who is a minor or if
                        you bring a minor to a Service Provider Service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf
                        of the minor and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor.
                    </p>
                <br>
                <h4>4.2 Your Assumption of Risk.</h4>
                    <p class="other_p">You acknowledge that many activities carry inherent risks and
                        agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you assume the entire risk
                        arising out of your access to and use of the Sykel Platform and any Content, including your
                        duration of the rental, participation in any Experience, use of any other Service Provider
                        Service, or any other interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online. This
                        means it is your responsibility to investigate a Service Provider Service to determine whether it
                        is suitable for you. For example, Service Provider Services may carry risk of illness, bodily
                        injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to
                        participate in those Service Provider Services.

                <h4>5.2 Contracting with Users.</h4>
                    <p class="other_p">When you accept a booking request, or receive a booking
                        confirmation through the Sykel Platform, you are entering into a contract directly with the User,

                    <p class="other_p">The Sykel APP Platform provides tools that make it
                        easy for you to set up and manage a Listing or interactions between Users. Your Listing must
                        include complete and accurate information about your Service Provider Service, your price,
                        other charges that may be specified, and any rules or requirements that apply to your Users or
                        Listing. You are responsible for keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability)
                        and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times. We recommend that you obtain
                        appropriate insurance for your Service Provider Services and suggest you carefully review
                        policy terms and conditions including coverage details and exclusions. You may only maintain
                        one Listing per vehicle. Any offer of an Experience is subject to our Additional Terms for

                        prohibited altogether. Check your local rules to learn what rules apply to the Service Provider
                        Services you plan to offer. Information we provide regarding legal requirements is for
                        informational purposes only and you should independently confirm your obligations. You are

                <h4>6.3 Search Ranking.</h4>
                    <p class="other_p">The ranking of Listings in search results on the Sykel APP Platform
                        depends on a variety of factors, including these main parameters:
                        <br>
                            ⦿ User search parameters (e.g. number of Users, time and duration of the trip, price range)<br>

                                Reviews, type of Service Provider Service, Service Provider status, age of the Listing,
                                average User popularity)<br>

                        Search results may appear different on our mobile application than they appear on our website.
                        Sykel may allow Service Providers to promote their Listings in search or elsewhere on the Sykel
                        APP Platform by paying an additional fee. More information about the factors that determine
                        how your Listing appears in search results, our current promotional programs (if any), and how

                <h4>7.1 Cancellations and Travel Issues.</h4>
                    <p class="other_p">In general, if a User cancels a Reservation, the amount
                        paid to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that Reservation. As a
                        Service Provider, you should not cancel on a User without a valid reason under our Extenuating
                        Circumstances Policy or applicable law. If you cancel on a User without such a valid reason, we
                        may impose a cancellation fee and other consequences. If: (i) a User experiences a Travel
                        Issue (as defined by the User Refund Policy), (ii) an Extenuating Circumstance arises, or (iii) a
                        Reservation is cancelled under Section 13 of these Terms, the amount you are paid will be
                        reduced by the amount we refund or otherwise provide to the User, and by any other
                        reasonable costs we incur as a result of the cancellation. If a User receives a refund after you
                        have already been paid, or the amount of the refund and other costs incurred by Sykel exceeds
                        your payout, Sykel may recover that amount from you, including by offsetting the refund against
                        your future payouts. You agree that Sykel`s User Refund Policy, Extenuating Circumstances
                        Policy, and these Terms preempt the cancellation policy you set in situations where they allow
                        for the cancellation of a Reservation and/or the issuance of refunds to Users. If we reasonably
                        expect to provide a refund to a User under one of these policies, we may delay release of any
                        payout for that Reservation until a refund decision is made. If you Service Provider an
                        Experience please note that the Experience Cancellation Policy, Experiences User Refund
                        Policy and different cancellation fees and consequences apply to your Reservations. See
                        each Policy for details about what is covered, and what your payout will be in each situation.
