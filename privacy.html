                        enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend a SYKEL Account for fraud or safety
                        reasons, we may retain information from that SYKEL Account to prevent that Member
                        from opening a new SYKEL Account in the future.<br>
                        ⦿ We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with

                        ⦿ Information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews, forum postings) will continue to
                        be publicly visible on SYKEL, even after your SYKEL Account is canceled. However,
                        attribution of such information to you will be removed. Some copies of your information

                        identifiers.<br>
                        ⦿ Because we take measures to protect data from accidental or malicious loss and
